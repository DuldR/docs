# Purpose

Our services exist to allow people to create and share their thoughts without
the need to set up their own server or be part of a platform that shows ads or
tracks its users. Ethics

We are committed to:

- No browser-based tracking of visitor behavior.
- No attempt to identify users.
- Never sell any user or visitor data.
- No ads â€” ever.

# Code of Content Publication

Content in pico.sh services is unfiltered and unmonitored. Users are free to
publish any combination of words and pixels except for: content of animosity or
disparagement of an individual or a group on account of a group characteristic
such as race, color, national origin, sex, disability, religion, or sexual
orientation, which will be taken down immediately.

If one notices something along those lines in a blog please let us know at
hello@pico.sh.

# Liability

The user expressly understands and agrees that pico.sh, the operator of this
website shall not be liable, in law or in equity, to them or to any third party
for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential,
punitive or exemplary damages.

# Analytics

We are committed to zero browser-based tracking or trying to identify visitors.
This means we do not try to understand the user based on cookies or IP address.
We do not store personally identifiable information.

However, in order to provide a better service, we do have some analytics on
content. List of metrics we track for content:

- anonymous view counts

We might also inspect the headers of HTTP requests to determine some tertiary
information about the request. For example we might inspect the User-Agent or
Referer to filter out requests from bots.

# Account Terms

The user is responsible for all content posted and all actions performed with
their account. We reserve the right to disable or delete a user's account for
any reason at any time. We have this clause because, statistically speaking,
there will be people trying to do something nefarious.

# Service Availability

We provide pico.sh services on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We do not
offer service-level agreements but do take uptime seriously.
