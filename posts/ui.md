# SSH TUI

With this TUI you can perform a few basic operations like: create an account,
manage pubkeys, manage API tokens.

To use the TUI just SSH into our site:

```bash
ssh pico.sh
```

# SSH CLI

Many of our services make use of the user providing argument to `ssh`:

```bash
ssh pico.sh help
ssh pgs.sh help
ssh prose.sh help
ssh imgs.sh help
```
