# SSH TUI

With this TUI you can perform a few basic operations like: create an account,
manage pubkeys, manage API tokens.

To use the TUI just SSH into our site:

```bash
ssh pico.sh
```

# SSH CLI

Some of our services have a built-in cli with our `ssh` service:

```bash
ssh pgs.sh help
ssh feeds.pico.sh help
ssh pipe.pico.sh help
```
