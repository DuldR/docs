# Account Data

In order to have a functional account at pico.sh, we need to store your public
key, and a username. We don't require an email in order to use our services.
However, when purchasing `pico+`, we do have access to sensitive information
through our payments provider: name, address, email. We do store transaction
information in order to track membership status.

Because we use public-key cryptography, our security posture is a battle-tested
and proven technique for authentication.

We also might ask for your email address in order to support some features of
our services. We will not share your email address with anyone, ever. We will
only email you when:

- You ask us to
- Service interuptions
- Service availability
- Membership status

# Logging

We store log files, or data about what happens on our servers. This helps us
prevent abuse and ensure no one is accessing our servers that shouldn't be.

Our web servers temporarily store information about what IP address connected
when. This data is accessed exclusively by our system administrators and
developers as needed.

# Analytics

We are committed to zero browser-based tracking or trying to identify visitors.
This means we do not try to understand the user based on cookies or IP address.
We do not store personally identifiable information.

However, in order to provide a better service, we do have some analytics on
content. List of metrics we track for content:

- Anonymous view counts

We might also inspect the headers of HTTP requests to determine some tertiary
information about the request. For example we might inspect the User-Agent or
Referer to filter out requests from bots.

# Third parties

We have a strong commitment to never share any user data with any third-parties.

# Service Providers

We host our server on oracle cloud.

# Cookies

We do not use any cookies.
