# Account Data

In order to have a functional account at pico.sh, we need to store your public
key. That is the only piece of information we record for a user.

Because we use public-key cryptography, our security posture is a battle-tested
and proven technique for authentication.

We also might ask for your email address in order to support some features of
our services. We will not share your email address with anyone, ever. We will
only email you when:

- You ask us to
- Service interuptions
- Service availability

# Third parties

We have a strong commitment to never share any user data with any third-parties.

# Service Providers

We host our server on oracle cloud.

# Cookies

We do not use any cookies, not even account authentication.
