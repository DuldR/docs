# Create your account with Public-Key Cryptography

We don't need your email address.

To get started, simply SSH to our CMS:

```bash
ssh new@pico.sh
```

![pico-account-create](https://hey.imgs.sh/pico-account-create.png)

All we need to create an account is your username. This username will be used
for all of your service domains. For example, if your username is `glossy`, we
will create the following domains on your behalf:

```
glossy.prose.sh
glossy.pgs.sh
glossy.pastes.sh
```

After that, just set a username and you're ready to start using our services!
When you SSH again, use your username that you set in the CMS.

```bash
ssh glossy@pico.sh
```
