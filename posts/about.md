There are only two core team members at **pico.sh LLC**:

- [Eric Bower](https://bower.sh)
- [Antonio Mika](https://antoniomika.me)

We are two software engineers who love experimenting with new technologies.
Think of pico.sh as a hacker lab for us to bring new ideas to life.

While we are the core team members, we also have to acknowledge the larger
community. Without whom we would not be so energized to build tools and
services.

Email us at [hello@pico.sh](mailto:hello@pico.sh) with any questions.
