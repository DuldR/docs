keywords: [pico, tuns]

An `ngrok` alternative using just SSH.

> NOTICE: This is a premium [pico+](/plus) service

# Features

- A zero-install developer tool
- Host public web services on `localhost`
- Host public tcp services on `localhost`
- Share your local webserver privately with another user
- Managed [sish](https://docs.ssi.sh) service

Using SSH tunnels, we can forward requests to your localhost from https, wss,
and tcp.

# Use cases

Think of tuns as a developer tool. It is designed for the individual developer
who is looking to prototype, demo, or otherwise deploy services without the
overhead of managing a production environment with TLS, HTTP reverse proxy, and
provisioning cloud infrastructure.

By using tuns you get automatic and public https for local web services.

Want to prototype a web service without fully deploying it in the cloud? You can
go from starting a local web service to sharing it with the world using a single
SSH command.

Hosting public web services from your home has never been easier with tuns.

# Example Usage

```bash
# if you have a local webserver on localhost:8000:
ssh -R dev:80:localhost:8000 tuns.sh
# now anyone can access it at https://{user}-dev.tuns.sh
```

# tunmgr

A tunnel manager for docker services.

tunmgr automatically set's up tunnels for docker services. It utilizes `Expose`
ports as well as DNSNames (and the container name/id) to setup different
permutations of tunnels.

> [source code](https://github.com/picosh/tunmgr)

```yml
services:
  tunmgr:
    image: ghcr.io/picosh/tunmgr:latest
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
      - $HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519:/key:ro
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
      interval: 2s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 1s
  httpbin:
    image: kennethreitz/httpbin
    depends_on:
      tunmgr:
        condition: service_healthy
    # labels: # or provide tunnel names and ports explicitly
    #   tunmgr.names: httpbin # Comma separated list of names. Can be an empty
    #   tunmgr.ports: 80:80 $ Comma separated list of port maps. (remote:local)
    command: gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:80 httpbin:app -k gevent --access-logfile -
```

With that docker compose file `httpbin` will be exposed as a public service on
tuns.
